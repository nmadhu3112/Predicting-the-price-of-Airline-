The project aims to revolutionize the travel industry by developing an advanced predictive model that accurately forecasts airline prices. Using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and historical flight data of 2019,the project is capable of accurately predicting future airline ticket prices. By analyzing factors such as travel seasonality, flight routes, source, destination, duration, demand patterns, and other relevant variables, our model offers users valuable insights to make informed decisions and secure the best deals. With this project, travelers can say goodbye to the frustration of constantly fluctuating prices and uncertain fare predictions, allowing them to plan their trips with confidence. The innovative approach combines ML models to provide updates on ticket prices, helping users make timely bookings and potentially save significant amounts of money. The impact of the project extends beyond individual travelers, it also assists travel agencies, airlines, and other industry stakeholders in understanding market trends and optimizing their pricing strategies.
